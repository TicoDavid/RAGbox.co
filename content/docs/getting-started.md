## Phase 2: Ingest Evidence

Feed your documents into the system. We accept all major formats.

### Supported Intelligence Formats:
- **PDF** — Contracts, reports, legal filings
- **DOCX/DOC** — Word documents, memos
- **TXT/MD** — Plain text, markdown files
- **XLSX/CSV** — Spreadsheets, data exports

### Upload Methods:

2. **Click to Upload** — Use the **+ Add** button in the left rail

The system will vectorize your documents automatically. This typically takes 5-30 seconds per document depending on size.
