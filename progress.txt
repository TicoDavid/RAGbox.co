## Notes
- Critical path: S001 → S002 → S005 → S006 → S007 → S008 → S009 → S010 → S011 → S013 → S014
- GCP services needed early: Cloud Storage, Vertex AI, Cloud Run
- Consider Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instead of AlloyDB for faster MVP (AlloyDB setup takes longer)

---

## Metrics
- Total Stories: 25
- Completed: 0
- In Progress: 0
- Remaining: 25
- Estimated Story Points: ~95

---

## Blockers/Risks
- GCP project setup required before S008+
- Firebase project needed before S005
- AlloyDB provisioning can take 30+ minutes (consider Cloud SQL for MVP)
