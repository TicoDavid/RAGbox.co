## ACTIVE DECISIONS

[2026-02-18] GO-TO-MARKET MODEL — David — RAGböx is a standalone SaaS product shipping independently. NOT a sub-module of ATHENA. ATHENA integration is future roadmap.

[2026-02-18] FIRST VERTICAL — Dr. Insane — Legal only. Ship one vertical brilliantly. Healthcare, Finance, Real Estate are Q2 fast-follows.

[2026-02-18] BETA ACCESS — Dr. Insane — Invite-only. 50 codes. 20 David's network, 20 inbound, 10 investor demos. Format: RBX-LEGAL-XXXXXX.

[2026-02-21] PRICING — DAVID (Jerry 2+1 model, approved) — Sovereign $99/mo (core RAG platform), Mercury $99/mo (voice + communication add-on), Syndicate $25K+ (enterprise/custom). Replaces prior 3-tier pricing.

[2026-02-18] DEMO CONTENT — Dr. Insane — Synthetic but realistic. 8 legal PDFs generated. We control the narrative.

[2026-02-18] LANDING PAGE — Dr. Insane — Ship as-is on GHL. Add "Request Beta Access" CTA. Polish after 10 paying users.

[2026-02-18] VOICE IN DEMO — Dr. Insane — OFF. "Voice coming soon" in UI. No "Connecting..." states anywhere. Non-negotiable for demo credibility.

[2026-02-18] DOMAIN MAPPING — Sheldon — ragbox.co stays on GHL (marketing). app.ragbox.co maps to Cloud Run (product). Do NOT touch ragbox.co DNS.

[2026-02-18] CHUNK OVERLAP — Sheldon — 15% for legal clause boundary preservation. Standardize across pipeline.

[2026-02-18] EVELYN MONROE — DAVID — PRODUCTION-GRADE. Not a demo prop. Full error handling, permissions, audit events, stable routing. Ship it right.

[2026-02-18] VOICE ARCHITECTURE — DAVID — INWORLD. Fix it, don't replace it. Cartesia is not the path.

[2026-02-18] TIMELINE — DAVID — HOT DEADLINE. Build now. No buffer. Ship ASAP.

[2026-02-18] EVELYN AUTH FIX — Sheldon — Agent email routes must enforce tenant-scoped authorization before shipping production Evelyn. Spec: .team/SPEC_EVELYN_PRODUCTION.md. Auth change — requires Sheldon review before merge.
