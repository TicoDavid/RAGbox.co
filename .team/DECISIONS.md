## ACTIVE DECISIONS

[2026-02-18] GO-TO-MARKET MODEL — David — RAGböx is a standalone SaaS product shipping independently. NOT a sub-module of ATHENA. ATHENA integration is future roadmap.

[2026-02-18] FIRST VERTICAL — Dr. Insane — Legal only. Ship one vertical brilliantly. Healthcare, Finance, Real Estate are Q2 fast-follows.

[2026-02-18] BETA ACCESS — Dr. Insane — Invite-only. 50 codes. 20 David's network, 20 inbound, 10 investor demos. Format: RBX-LEGAL-XXXXXX.

[2026-02-18] PRICING — Dr. Insane (awaiting David approval) — Starter $149/mo (1 vault, 500 docs), Professional $399/mo (3 vaults, 2000 docs, Mercury included), Enterprise $999/mo (unlimited, API access). Mercury is add-on at Starter, included at Professional+.

[2026-02-18] DEMO CONTENT — Dr. Insane — Synthetic but realistic. 8 legal PDFs generated. We control the narrative.

[2026-02-18] LANDING PAGE — Dr. Insane — Ship as-is on GHL. Add "Request Beta Access" CTA. Polish after 10 paying users.

[2026-02-18] VOICE IN DEMO — Dr. Insane — OFF. "Voice coming soon" in UI. No "Connecting..." states anywhere. Non-negotiable for demo credibility.

[2026-02-18] DOMAIN MAPPING — Sheldon — ragbox.co stays on GHL (marketing). app.ragbox.co maps to Cloud Run (product). Do NOT touch ragbox.co DNS.

[2026-02-18] CHUNK OVERLAP — Sheldon — 15% for legal clause boundary preservation. Standardize across pipeline.

[2026-02-18] EVELYN MONROE — PENDING DAVID — Demo-grade or production-grade? Determines polish level.

[2026-02-18] VOICE ARCHITECTURE — PENDING DAVID — Fix Inworld or pivot to Cartesia? Blocks post-launch voice work.

[2026-02-18] TIMELINE — PENDING DAVID — 3-day sprint confirmed? Hard deadline?

[2026-02-18] PRICING APPROVAL — PENDING DAVID — $149/$399/$999 needs sign-off.
